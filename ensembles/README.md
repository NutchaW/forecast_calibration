# Data folder structure

Prior to running scripts in `ensemble_code`, 

1) Unzip all zip files in this folder and all subfolders in the `pit_ls_frame` fold.
2) The `final_ensembles` and `cv_ensembles` folders are empty, but contain multiple empty subfolders needed to store data created from scripts in this repository.
